<h2>CHRISTOPHER'S COLLECTIONS</h2>

    <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
    <p>Graphic Designer</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" >
    <h2>DELIVERABLES</h2>
    <p> Logos, A Poster, and An Animation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" >
    <h2>PROJECT DURATION</h2>
    <p> 3 weeks on the entire project, 1 week for each deliverable</p>

<div class="row">

    <h2>BRIEF</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p> Personal logo, poster, and animation based on client’s personal statements - including his personality, experiences and expectation for this project. <a href= "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/u2eiut41rduoyf75b5qoe/Christopher-Personal-Branding-Statement.docx?dl=0&rlkey=t4drga1xs1qz2gjn13a4q4bv8">Check out Christopher’s story here. </a><br>
	</p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="columnp" >
    <h2>PROJECT GOAL</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p> Expressing client’s personality through eye-catching, stylish designed deliverables based on his own experience. </p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="columnp" >
    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p> Limited information received from the clients, who also did not have a specific requirement for the final products </p>
  </div>
	
<div class="columnp" >
    <h2>MY CONTRIBUTION</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp" >
    <p> I am the sole designer that worked on this project; therefore, I fulfilled all of the client requests myself. </p>
  </div>
	
<div class="columnp" >
    <h2>PERSONAL LOGOS</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp" >
	 <p> I created two versions of the logo for Christopher. They are identical in design but different in colour. The logo is in a box-like shape inspired by Pandora's Box. Christopher is concerned about switching to a new program since his old programs offered him lots of job opportunities. Pandora's Box is something that creates lots of unexpected problems, which is relative to the situations mentioned in the client brief. Moreover, the only thing left in Pandora’s box is “Hope,” so I use Bright Colors and intense fonts for the logos. </p>

    <h2>POSTER</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp1" >
	 <p> The poster I designed for Christopher is inspired by cyberpunk and glitch arts. There are lots of purposely distortions applied to the poster design to reflect Christopher’s uncertainty in life. Unlike the animation, the poster is based on Christopher’s past experiences as an engineering student, and when he was struggling with STEM courses and exploring what he really likes. Therefore, the colour choices for the poster are comparatively monotoned, expressing his anxiety and depression. </p>

    <h2>ANIMATION</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp1" >
	 <p> The “Christopher.gif” is the first animation project I created using Adobe After Effect. I animated “the Christopher poster” by replacing the black background with an animated pink and green one. <br> <br>The keywords of my design are intense and impressive. Thus, I picked two bright complementary colours in order to create the gradual tension. In order to create the contrast, I used a dark background colour for the first four seconds and replaced it with a light and bright background in pink and green afterward. I aimed to capture his transformative experience (changing his major from Engineering to a design-focused degree) through my animation. Engineering is more academic and informative compared to an arts program; thus, the background colour I used at the beginning is relatively plain and achromatic. However, designing is comparative, flexible, and energetic compared to engineering; thus, I wanted to juxtapose the neutral colour with a bright colour.
