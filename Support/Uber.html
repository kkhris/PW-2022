    <h2>BRIEF</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p>Wireframe and prototype of the enhanced version of Uber Eats</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <h2>PROJECT GOAL</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p> Create new features for Uber Eat to increase user experience. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="columnp" >
    <p>Users spend lots of time deciding what food they should get, the food delivery status is not shown in detail, and customers are likely to be irritated since they do not know why it takes so long.  </p>
  </div>
<div class="columnp" >
    <h2>MY CONTRIBUTION</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp" >
    <p> I am the sole designer that works on this project; therefore, I fulfilled all of the client requests myself.</p>
  </div>
<div class="columnp" >
    <h2>TARGET USER</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp" >
    <p> - People who are busy deciding what they should eat and people who are indecisive <br> <br> - People who need recommendations for food
</p>
  </div>
<div class="columnp" >
    <h2>NEW FEATURES</h2>
  </div>
	 <div class="columnp" >
    <p> <strong> FOOD DELIVERY STATUS </strong> <br> <br>

The current version of Uber Eats only provides an estimated time of delivery. Thus, customers are likely to be irritated by the long waiting time since they cannot track the exact status of their deliveries. Therefore, I would like to include a progress bar that displays the remaining time. The icon at the top of the remaining time countdown timer represents the current status of the food. For instance, the “New features A” screen shows that the remaining time is around 8 minutes, and the icon shows food is ready to be picked up by the delivery driver. As a result, I believe including the status of the order could be a user-friendly choice to improve user engagement and reassure the customer that their food is on the way.
</p>
<p> <strong> BUDGET & EXPENSES </strong> <br> <br>
To help users from meeting their own financial goals, including a new feature related to budgeting and expenses could be really helpful. Even though the current version of Uber Eats automatically records and stores users' past orders, they do not calculate users' total expenses and generate a periodical bill for users. Thus, users do not realize that they are overspending until they see their empty bank account. The new feature allows users to set up their weekly, monthly, and annual budgets and visualize the total expenses through a progress bar and line chart. Users can also find out how much they spend on each meal by checking the transaction history. Therefore, the budget and expenses feature is a user-friendly feature to help users properly manage their spending.
</p>
		 
<p> <strong> MAGIC FOOD BOX </strong> <br> <br>
Magic food box is a feature that randomly chooses the user’s next meal based on the time of day, budget, and any special requests. The feature would be extremely friendly for people who are struggling to make a decision or are too busy to decide what to eat. Users could access the Magic food box by clicking on the button with a question mark icon beside the monthly budget progress bar. To adjust the budget of a meal, users could drag the green dot on the scale bar and customize the values. The remaining monthly budget would also display on the top of the scale bar. Moreover, users are able to select a type of food that they prefer to order and include their requests for food. As shown in the New features C5 and C6, the user is a vegetarian with an almond allergy, who prefers American food under 20 dollars. Therefore, the food and drinks recommended by Magic Food Box are absolutely vegetarian friendly, almond-free, and under 20 dollars.
